# **Survey Questionnaire**

This is a Laravel-based web application designed to create, manage, and analyze surveys or questionnaires. This project uses PHP with Laravel and Blade because PHP is a versatile language well-suited for web development.

Laravel was chosen for its powerful features like routing, authentication, and database management, which make backend development faster and more efficient. Blade, Laravel's built-in templating engine, allows for clean and reusable templates, making it easier to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. Using both together ensures the project is well-structured, scalable, and easy to maintain.
